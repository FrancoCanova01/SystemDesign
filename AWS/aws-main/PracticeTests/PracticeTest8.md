## Review Security
- An application hosted in an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances is used to process data polled from an SQS queue and the generated output is stored in an S3 bucket. To improve security, you were tasked to ensure that all objects in the S3 bucket are encrypted at rest using server-side encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys (SSE-KMS). Which of the following is required to properly implement this requirement?
    - Add a bucket policy which denies any s3:PutObject action unless the request includes the x-amz-server-side-encryption header
    - Adding a bucket policy which denies any s3:PutObject action unless the request includes the x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header 
    - Adding a bucket policy which denies any s3:PostObject action unless the request includes the x-amz-server-side-encryption header
    - Adding a bucket policy which denies any s3:PostObject action unless the request includes the x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header

- A website is hosted in an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. It also uses CloudFront with a default domain name to distribute its static assets and dynamic contents. However, the website has a poor search ranking as it doesn't use a secure HTTPS/SSL on its site. Which are the possible solutions that the developer can implement in order to set up HTTPS communication between the viewers and CloudFront? (Select TWO.)
    - Using a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate in the ALB which is stored in a private S3 bucket
    - Viewer Protocol Policy to use Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    - Configuring the ALB to use its default SSL/TLS certificate
    - Using a self-signed certificate in the ALB
    - Viewer Protocol Policy to use HTTPS Only

- A developer is working on a photo-sharing application that can automatically add filters to the images uploaded by its users. For every new image that the user uploads, it will be handled by an image processing application hosted in a Lambda function. The processed image would then be stored in an S3 bucket. If the upload was successful, the application will return a prompt telling the user that the upload is successful. However, the entire processing typically takes an average of 5 minutes to complete, which causes the application to become unresponsive. Which of the following is the MOST suitable and cost-effective option which will prevent your application from being unresponsive?
    - Using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to allow asynchronous requests to your Lambda function
    - configure the application to asynchronously process the requests and change the invocation type of the Lambda function to Event.
    - Configuring the application to asynchronously process the requests and use the default invocation type of the Lambda function
    - Using a combination of Lambda and Step Functions to orchestrate service components and asynchronously process the requests

- A serverless application, which is composed of Lambda functions integrated with API Gateway and DynamoDB, processes ad hoc requests that are sent by its users. Due to the recent spike in incoming traffic, some of your customers are complaining that they are getting HTTP 504 errors from time to time. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?
    - An authorization failure occurred between API Gateway and the Lambda function
    - The usage plan quota has been exceeded for the Lambda function
    - Since the incoming requests are increasing, the API Gateway automatically enabled throttling which caused the HTTP 504 errors.
    - API Gateway request has timed out because the underlying Lambda function has been running for more than 29 seconds.

- A web application is running in an ECS Cluster and updates data in DynamoDB several times a day. The clients retrieve data directly from the DynamoDB through APIs exposed by Amazon API Gateway. Although API caching is enabled, there are specific clients that want to retrieve the latest data from DynamoDB for every API request sent. What should be done to only allow authorized clients to invalidate an API Gateway cache entry when submitting API requests? (Select TWO.)
    - Instructing the client to send a request which contains the Cache-Control: max-age=1 header
    - Providing your clients an authorization token from STS to query data directly from DynamoDB
    - Tick the Require Authorization checkbox in the Cache Settings of your API via the console and instruct the client to send a request which contains the Cache-Control: max-age=0 header. 
    - Modifying the cache settings to retrieve the latest data from DynamoDB if the request header's authorization signature matches your API's trusted clients list
